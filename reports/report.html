<h1>Exam template for 02476 Machine Learning Operations</h1>
<p>This is the report template for the exam. Please only remove the text formatted as with three dashes in front and behind
like:</p>
<p><code>--- question 1 fill here ---</code></p>
<p>where you instead should add your answers. Any other changes may have unwanted consequences when your report is auto
generated in the end of the course. For questions where you are asked to include images, start by adding the image to
the <code>figures</code> subfolder (please only use <code>.png</code>, <code>.jpg</code> or <code>.jpeg</code>) and then add the following code in your answer:</p>
<p><code>markdown
![my_image](figures/&lt;image&gt;.&lt;extension&gt;)</code></p>
<p>In addition to this markdown file, we also provide the <code>report.py</code> script that provides two utility functions:</p>
<p>Running:</p>
<p><code>bash
python report.py html</code></p>
<p>will generate an <code>.html</code> page of your report. After deadline for answering this template, we will autoscrape
everything in this <code>reports</code> folder and then use this utility to generate an <code>.html</code> page that will be your serve
as your final handin.</p>
<p>Running</p>
<p><code>bash
python report.py check</code></p>
<p>will check your answers in this template against the constrains listed for each question e.g. is your answer too
short, too long, have you included an image when asked to.</p>
<p>For both functions to work it is important that you do not rename anything. The script have two dependencies that can
be installed with <code>pip install click markdown</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Enter the group number you signed up on <learn.inside.dtu.dk></strong></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>1</p>
<h3>Question 2</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Enter the study number for each member in the group</strong></p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p><em>sXXXXXX, sXXXXXX, sXXXXXX</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>s194369, s194340, s194331, s194349</p>
<h3>Question 3</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What framework did you choose to work with and did it help you complete the project?</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We used the third-party framework ... in our project. We used functionality ... and functionality ... from the</em>
<em>package to do ... and ... in our project</em>.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have in our project used different third-party frameworks for different functionalities. We have first used pytorch lighting for our model. Where there is different models, that can be used. From timm we used the pretrained ResNet class and to be more specific we used the model resnet18. We also used hydra to train with hyperparamters. Another third-party we used was Weights &amp; Biases to log training progress.</p>
<h2>Coding environment</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In the following section we are interested in learning more about you local development environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Question 4</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Explain how you managed dependencies in your project? Explain the process a new team member would have to go</strong>
<strong>through to get an exact copy of your environment.</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 100-200 words</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We used ... for managing our dependencies. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using ... . To get a</em>
<em>complete copy of our development environment, one would have to run the following commands</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our packages are managed in a conda environment. Therefor the required packages for our project is in the requirements.txt this file can be found in the top folder of our projects structure which is created using cookiecutter. In this file we have all our packages and the versions used in this project. We have also a a make file which includes how to set up environment, requriments etc. To get a complete copy of our development environment one would have to run the following comands:
<code>git clone https://github.com/luchsonice/2024_MLOps_1.git
make create_environment
make requirements
dvc pull
make data</code>
Also it is assumed that it is python version 10</p>
<h3>Question 5</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>We expect that you initialized your project using the cookiecutter template. Explain the overall structure of your</strong>
<strong>code. Did you fill out every folder or only a subset?</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 100-200 words</p>
<p>Example:
<em>From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the ... , ... and ... folder. We have removed the ... folder</em>
<em>because we did not use any ... in our project. We have added an ... folder that contains ... for running our</em>
<em>experiments.</em>
Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We used the cookiecutter template, so our overall folder struckture follows this. In the cookiecutter structure we have filled out the dvc. In the github folder we have our github workflows (so workflow folder from the template is empty). congigs folder with our Training configuration, the data folder with our data. In the dockfiles folder we the files to make dockerfiles. src folder with our model. The test folder to have our test in. We have not used the notebooks folder, and as mentioned before the workflow folder have we not used because our workflows are in the github folder.</p>
<h3>Question 6</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you implement any rules for code quality and format? Additionally, explain with your own words why these</strong>
<strong>concepts matters in larger projects.</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 50-100 words.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the project we have written comments. We have tried to do so that our code follows the pep8 compliant, however we have not used any checks to ensure this.
These concepts matter in large project because when multiple people work on the code it is still important that code is in the same format and when other people (that has not worked with code before) has to use it. It is easier if the quality of the code and format is standard and the same for all the code.</p>
<h2>Version control</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In the following section we are interested in how version control was used in your project during development to
corporate and increase the quality of your code.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Question 7</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How many tests did you implement and what are they testing in your code?</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 50-100 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>In total we have implemented X tests. Primarily we are testing ... and ... as these the most critical parts of our</em>
<em>application but also ... .</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In total we have implemented 2 united tests. The test_data and test_model files in the tests folder. In the test_data we have a few test for the data. First we test that there is the correct amount om images in test and train. We also test that the dimensions of all images are correct and lastly we test that the labels are correct. Then for the test_model file here we have one test and it tests if we get the correct output given the input. So we have a toatal of 4 tests.</p>
<h3>Question 8</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What is the total code coverage (in percentage) of your code? If you code had an code coverage of 100% (or close</strong>
<strong>to), would you still trust it to be error free? Explain you reasoning.</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>The total code coverage of code is X%, which includes all our source code. We are far from 100% coverage of our **
</em>code and even if we were then...*</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>--- question 8 fill here ---</p>
<h3>Question 9</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you workflow include using branches and pull requests? If yes, explain how. If not, explain how branches and</strong>
<strong>pull request can help improve version control.</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We made use of both branches and PRs in our project. In our group, each member had an branch that they worked on in</em>
<em>addition to the main branch. To merge code we ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the project we used branches, we used these when we were working at different parts, to both protect the main and also so it was easier when different people were implementing different parts. We would therefor also use pull request, however to make it easier the pull request would only contain one new feature. This helped making sure that we did not have to many branches at once but also making mering the branches with main easier, since it would only be a few new things. When a pull request was done we would look it over and also try the code to ensure it worked.</p>
<h3>Question 10</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you use DVC for managing data in your project? If yes, then how did it improve your project to have version</strong>
<strong>control of your data. If no, explain a case where it would be beneficial to have version control of your data.</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We did make use of DVC in the following way: ... . In the end it helped us in ... for controlling ... part of our</em>
<em>pipeline</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We did in our project use DVC for managing data. We first stored our data on google drive but also ended up using google cloud later on. We did use the whole dataset and did not change anything during the project so here perhaps the fact we used DVC was not so important. However if we had to add more data or change (could be only using a subset of the data) the data then DVC could have helped with that with it's version control. One thing DVC did was making it easy to get the data and if someone else had to use our project it would be very easy for them to get the data, since it only requires a few commands.</p>
<h3>Question 11</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Discuss you continues integration setup. What kind of CI are you running (unittesting, linting, etc.)? Do you test</strong>
<strong>multiple operating systems, python version etc. Do you make use of caching? Feel free to insert a link to one of</strong>
<strong>your github actions workflow.</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 200-300 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We have organized our CI into 3 separate files: one for doing ..., one for running ... testing and one for running</em>
<em>... . In particular for our ..., we used ... .An example of a triggered workflow can be seen here: <weblink></em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>--- question 11 fill here ---</p>
<h2>Running code and tracking experiments</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In the following section we are interested in learning more about the experimental setup for running your code and
especially the reproducibility of your experiments.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Question 12</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How did you configure experiments? Did you make use of config files? Explain with coding examples of how you would</strong>
<strong>run a experiment.</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 50-100 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We used a simple argparser, that worked in the following way: python my_script.py --lr 1e-3 --batch_size 25</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In our project we had a configs folder in which a configuration file was. It had the hyperparamters: the batch size of the model, learning rate and number of epochs. The configuration file was used by:
<code>batch_size = config['batch_size']
lr = config['lr']
num_epochs = config['num_epochs']</code>
For Weights and Biases the configuration file is simply just given in the WandbLogger(config=config).</p>
<h3>Question 13</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Reproducibility of experiments are important. Related to the last question, how did you secure that no information</strong>
<strong>is lost when running experiments and that your experiments are reproducible?</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We made use of config files. Whenever an experiment is run the following happens: ... . To reproduce an experiment</em>
<em>one would have to do ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In our project we made use of config files for hyperparameters and we used wandb. This makes it easy to see what parameters are used to train with. To be able to track the parameters used wandb In our github repository we have a folder called wandb, which has a config file that has our parameters. Also in wandb  it is possible to see all experimentes runed with the hyperparamters used. So to reproduce an experiment one would update the configs files in the folder configs with the parameters from the experimnet which they want to reproduced found using either the folder wandb or on the wandb website. To be able reproduce the exact results one would also need to set a seed in the config file.  </p>
<h3>Question 14</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Upload 1 to 3 screenshots that show the experiments that you have done in W&amp;B (or another experiment tracking</strong>
<strong>service of your choice). This may include loss graphs, logged images, hyperparameter sweeps etc. You can take</strong>
<strong>inspiration from <a href="figures/wandb.png">this figure</a>. Explain what metrics you are tracking and why they are</strong>
<strong>important.</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 200-300 words + 1 to 3 screenshots.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>As seen in the first image when have tracked ... and ... which both inform us about ... in our experiments.</em>
<em>As seen in the second image we are also tracking ... and ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Wanb we have used have first tracked the training loss <br />
<img alt="my_image" src="figures/q14-trainloss.png" /><br />
We can see that we have a decrease in the training loss for the first many steps and around 20 steps for some of the models the loss flatten out or even decrasing. We have also tracked the validation loss  <br />
<img alt="my_image" src="figures/q14-valloss.png" /><br /></p>
<h3>Question 15</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Docker is an important tool for creating containerized applications. Explain how you used docker in your</strong>
<strong>experiments? Include how you would run your docker images and include a link to one of your docker files.</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>For our project we developed several images: one for training, inference and deployment. For example to run the</em>
<em>training docker image: <code>docker run trainer:latest lr=1e-3 batch_size=64</code>. Link to docker file: <weblink></em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Question 16</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>When running into bugs while trying to run your experiments, how did you perform debugging? Additionally, did you</strong>
<strong>try to profile your code or do you think it is already perfect?</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>Debugging method was dependent on group member. Some just used ... and others used ... . We did a single profiling</em>
<em>run of our main code at some point that showed ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When running into bugs in the project we used different things we have used print statements a lot. But also used pdb once to debug the code. However when using the debugger it said that everything was the problem. Which did not really help us that much. So we had to try removing elements in our code until we found the error.
We did also run a single profiling on the code. The from the profiling we could see that what took the longest was function which we could not change. So from profiling we did not find anything we could do to make the code faster.</p>
